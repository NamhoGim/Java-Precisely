## Examples from Peter Sestoft: Java Precisely, third edition, MIT Press 2016

These files are from http://www.itu.dk/~sestoft/javaprecisely/

Java Precisely and its example programs come with no warranty of any
kind, either expressed or implied.  In no event shall the author or
the IT University of Copenhagen or the MIT Press be liable for any
damage resulting from its use.

The source code for Example 1 is in file Example1.java, and so on.

Most examples are compiled and ready to run; running them requires
Java Development Kit 8.0 or later.

For instance, to run the program from Example 5, unpack the example
archive and type

   java Example5

Some example programs require additional command line argument; they
will say so if invoked without command line arguments.

The programs Example91.java and Example92.java may be run with option
-ea or -enableassertions like this:

    java -enableassertions Example91
    java -enableassertions Example92
